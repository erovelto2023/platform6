🧠 How to Get the Best Results from Your ChatGPT Projects
To get the best content out of ChatGPT Projects, you need more than just your brand info and system prompts — you must guide the AI with clarity. The questions below help you do exactly that. When you fill them out, you're not just giving the AI direction — you're ensuring the message is on point, emotionally resonant, and tailored to the right person at the right time. This is how you go from generic content to content that actually connects, converts, and sounds like you.

Use this Custom GPT here:
https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67e33072f48c8191808d8c990b51fdd2-perfect-prompt-wizard


Or answer the questions manually below


—--
1. What is the topic you want to create content about?
This is the core subject of your message — similar to a headline or the main idea. It tells the AI what to talk about. Keep it clear and concise.
Example: “5 Mistakes Coaches Make When Launching Their First Online Course”








2. What is the hook or main theme that should guide the tone and angle of this content?
This frames the entire piece. It’s the emotional or strategic lens the message should come through. Think of it as the “what makes this message different?”
Example: “You’re closer than you think — your course doesn’t need to be perfect to be profitable.”








3. What are 2–3 specific talking points you want to make sure are included?
These are the essential ideas or subtopics that must be covered in the content. Think of them as the points you'd write on a whiteboard before recording a video.
Example:
         * Most coaches overcomplicate their first course.
         * Simplicity wins over production quality.
         * You don’t need a big audience to make your first sales.







4. Why are we sending this message today, and why should the reader care right now?
This adds context and relevance. It’s the “why now?” that helps your message land with urgency and intention.
Example: “We’re sending this today because enrollment for our beta group closes in 48 hours.”








5. Who is this specific message meant for within your target audience?
Even if your brand has a general audience, this message should feel like it’s written to a specific subgroup or persona.
Example: “This message is for beginner creators who’ve never launched a product before and feel overwhelmed by tech.”








6. What urgency or scarcity elements can we include to inspire action?
People act when there’s a reason to do so now. Think about deadlines, limited spots, bonuses expiring, etc.
Example: “Only 25 seats available. Once they’re filled, we’re closing enrollment for 3 months.”








7. What action do you want the reader to take after reading the content?
Be crystal clear on the call to action. What should they do — click, reply, buy, book, etc.?
Example: “Click here to reserve your spot in the program before Friday at midnight.”






8. How long should this content be?
Specify the ideal length and tone. Are you looking for a short and punchy social post, a medium-length email, or a long-form blog?
Example: “Medium-length email — around 300 words, conversational but persuasive.”
